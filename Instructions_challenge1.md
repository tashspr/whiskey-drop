Bootstrap's core CSS has many other features we haven't mentioned.
Let's make use of one and add a new section to our landing page. 
This section will be called "Monthly favorites" and is going to contain 
a <table> of information with the top 5 whiskeys of the month. 
This table should have two columns: "name" and "origin" 
(the country the whiskey originated from).
